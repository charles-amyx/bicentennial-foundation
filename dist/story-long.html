                <p>
                    Stephen Prokofievitch Timoshenko, often called the “father of engineering mechanics” in the United States, led a movement that dramatically reshaped American engineering education in the early 20th century.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Timoshenko was professor of Engineering Mechanics at Michigan for just nine short years (1927-1936), in the era between the two World Wars, but his brief presence on the Ann Arbor campus had a profound impact not just on his students but on the entire field. Through his relentless research efforts, Timoshenko formulated the essential rules for how structures deform under stress; established the foundations of the theory of the elastic behavior of solid matter; and introduced scientific and mathematical approaches to mechanics instruction.

                <p>
                    At Michigan and then later at Stanford, Timoshenko helped to integrate the rigorous study of engineering mechanics—the branch of physical science that studies the response of solids and fluids to external forces—into the traditional hands-on American engineering curriculum. He did not reject practical engineering training; he simply wanted to give it a theoretical grounding. He wanted to teach engineers not only how things work but also why. Timoshenko essentially established the science-based engineering education that remains the worldwide standard today.

                    <strong>But this eminent teacher also lived two sets of lives—the first in Russia before the revolution; the second, afterward, in the United States.</strong> Timoshenko received an excellent Russian education, and quickly rose to prominence. But the Russian revolution forced him to become an itinerant scholar, often working under exceptionally difficult circumstances. When he arrived in the United States, at the age of 44, Timoshenko could not speak or understood very much English.

                <p>
                    Through the end of the 19th century, U.S. engineering education was focused on skill development. Engineering students mostly learned as apprentices, with time-intensive training. And most instructors believed this practical approach distinguished engineering from other science professions—and that employers not only desired but expected engineering graduates to possess a well-defined set of skills.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While more engineers were beginning to seek more formal educations at colleges and universities—and the “shop culture” was fading—most still continued to learn by doing. And resistance to change remained. Few instructors yearned to make radical changes to these time-honored traditions. And even fewer would admit they likely lacked the theoretical background to alter the curriculum even if they had wanted to.
                </p>
                <p>This hands-on pedagogical method, meanwhile, differed dramatically from the European approach, which emphasized basic science, mathematics, and research. So if American engineering education were going to change, it would have to come from someone on the outside.

                <h4 class="subheader">Timoshenko’s Early Years</h4>
                    <p>
                        Timoshenko was born on December 23, 1878, in a small village near Kiev, Russia. He entered high school in Romny in 1889, studied there for five years, and enrolled at the Institute of Ways of Communication, St. Petersburg, where he received his degree as a civil engineer in 1901.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As a student Timoshenko was able to save money from summer work, and with another 100 rubles from his father he traveled with a few friends to Europe, where he thrilled to the smart, clean, and efficient ways of the west. Upon returning to Kiev, what had once “seemed beautiful, smart” now “looked so poor: the cobbled street, rumbling four-wheel carts, shabby passenger traps, dirt everywhere, stench from cellars.”
                    </p>
                    <p>“Russia,” he wrote, “greets one joylessly.”</p>
                    <p>This first taste of travel appears to have set his life’s path. “Why was I such a ‘Westernizer’ [after this trip?]” he wrote. “I do not know, but Westernizer I have remained all my life.”</p>
                    <p>After graduation Timoshenko spent a year in the Army, where he took a keen personal interest in his fellow enlisted men, and organized and offered free lessons in arithmetic and other subjects. Afterward, Timoshenko returned to his alma mater as a mechanics instructor, and soon accepted a post as assistant professor at the Polytechnic Institute in St. Petersburg. By 1906, Timoshenko had become its chair of Applied Mathematics in Kiev. </p>
                    <p>Timoshenko taught Strength of Materials and the Theory of Structures, and his first published papers concerned the vibration and strength of shafts. He also found time during this period to spend part of each year studying in Munich with August Foppl and in Gottingen with Ludwig Prandtl—and to get married to Alexandra Archangelokaja, a medical student at that time. </p>
                    <p>Timoshenko’s time in Kiev was extremely productive. With no fewer than eight published papers on elasticity and elastic stability, and a collection of problems on strength of materials, Timoshenko was elected dean in 1909. But within just two short years, things would change drastically. </p>
                    <p>By 1911 the last remnants of the reforms of the previous decade in Russia were being liquidated one after the other. The quota on Jews admitted to institutes of higher learning, for instance, which had been ignored for several years, were now being enforced again—and the percentage of Jewish students at Kiev Polytechnic far exceeded the previously established quota. The regime’s Minister of Public Enlightenment insisted that the “excess” Jews be expelled, but the Institute’s top administrators—which included Timoshenko—“did not hurry to meet this demand.”</p>
                    <p>“The upshot,” wrote Timoshenko, “was that in early February 1911, three of the Institute’s deans, I among them, were fired—and suddenly found ourselves with no salary and without the government apartments that until then we had lived in. Out of a feeling of solidarity, the Left-oriented professors all submitted their resignations. The resignations were accepted, and the Polytechnic had suddenly lost 40 percent of its faculty.”</p>
                    <p id="sticky03">Timoshenko would not become officially associated with an educational institute for another two years. But his influence nonetheless grew. During this period he published some nine or ten papers on elasticity in Russian, French, and German. His first book, Strength of Materials, was published in Russian in 1911 (followed by 12 editions, through 1932). The first in a long series of his papers on thin elastic plates appeared in 1913. That same year Timoshenko became professor of the theory of elasticity at the Institute of Engineering of Way and Communication, and was chair of the Theory of Elasticity as Applied to Ships from 1914 until 1918. It was during these years that Timoshenko published his famous book, Theory of Elasticity.</p>
                    <h4 class="subheader">The Revolution</h4>
                    <p>As Russia entered its turbulent and violent period of revolution, travel was never easy, or without unexpected adventure, and Timoshenko and his family members often had to split up and remain apart for extended periods to avoid imminent danger. Constant skirmishes among opposing forces would often crop up, usually without warning, and with no discernible pattern.</p>
                    <p>By 1918, political and social unrest had worsened to such an extent that Timoshenko had to flee St. Petersburg—returning to Kiev in such haste that he took no possessions, or even any extra clothing, with him. In Kiev, Timoshenko associated with the anti-Bolshevik Volunteer Army (or White Forces)—and he knew, if the Bolsheviks overcame them, and retook Kiev, his status as a reserve ensign who had evaded the Bolshevik draft would be fraught with danger. </p>
                    <p>For weeks and sometimes months at a time he had to stay on the move, often scrounging for decent places to sleep and eat. As matters worsened, and the Bolshevist army advanced, Timoshenko planned various escape routes, and jockeyed among both official and unofficial means of obtaining appropriate passports and visas for his travels. Journeys, once begun, were sometimes altered when news would reach him that another town had been taken—often just before he was about to embark there. </p>
                    <p>But in so many instances, Timoshenko’s well-traveled past and professional renown provided for him what he called “luck”—meaning critical assistance from a well-placed former student, or a governmental and other official who had heard of him offering important information or documentation just in the nick of time. The most prominent of these “lucky” circumstances was the certificate he had once received following a tribute from the Society of French Engineers, which enabled him passage on a French steamer leaving from Sevastapol to Constantinople at a time when he thought he had exhausted all options. But as the French controlled who would gain passage, the certificate bought him a berth. </p>
                    <p>“This, I think,” wrote Timoshenko, “was the only time in my life that a certificate of academic distinction had any practical value.” </p>
                    <p>Timoshenko hurriedly boarded that ship to Constantinople, leaving his family behind in Kiev. This journey would require many stops along the way, but Timoshenko finally found himself in Zagreb, Yugoslavia, where he would become chair of Applied Mathematics in the Polytechnic Institute in Zagreb. </p>
                    <p>But peaceful work and study in Zagreb was short-lived. Word soon reached him that the Polish Army had invaded the Ukraine and had already taken Kiev. </p>
                    <p>“That was the very thing I was praying for,” Timoshenko wrote. “I had to act.” </p>
                    <p>Timoshenko was soon on his way back to Kiev by way of Vienna and Warsaw—where he was reunited with his family after a seven-month absence. Though many—including his family members—thought matters might improve with the Polish gaining control, Timoshenko understood that its hold on Kiev would be temporary. The Bolsheviks were already on its outskirts, Poles were being evacuated, and departure from Kiev once again could not be delayed. Trains leaving Kiev were accepting Poles, not Russians—but again a former student “luckily” intervened. And this student—an engineer in charge of boarding procedures—made certain a car was available to his former professor and his family. Timoshenko later learned that this was the last train out of Kiev. </p>
                    <p>The trip back to Zagreb was not without adventure, but the whole family arrived there safely—and once he found acceptable quarters for his family, Timoshenko finally returned to his work. Soon, however, he would receive a letter from a former student concerning an employment opportunity in America, and Timoshenko faced a difficult choice. </p>
                    <p>Timoshenko loved teaching, and he thought Zagreb was a fine city. But while he was earning enough money to feed and clothe his family, he had little money left for anything else. In America, he knew he would become more financially stable, if not prosperous. The main factor, though, was the language.</p>
                    <p>“I longed to have my books in Russian published in a Western-European language,” he wrote. After long hesitation he accepted the job, in Philadelphia—and took a leave of absence from the Polytechnic in Zagreb for three months, when he would decide whether to stay in America or return to Yugoslavia.</p>
                    <p id="sticky04">When decision time came, Timoshenko sent for his wife and youngest child but left the older two children at home to ensure that they would receive a Russian-style engineering education. Timoshenko already had seen enough of America to know that if his children were to join him there they would have received an inferior means of education.</p>
                    <h4 class="subheader">Work and Life in the United States</h4>
                    <p>Timoshenko left Philadelphia and his job as a consulting engineer with the Vibration Specialty Company after just one year for a better position with the Westinghouse Research Laboratory in Pittsburgh, where he also taught an evening seminar on strength of materials. Timoshenko’s students—new hires at Westinghouse—were all recent graduates of American engineering schools. When Timoshenko saw their college course notes, he was amazed at their complete lack of strength-of-materials theory training.</p>
                    <p>Timoshenko quickly realized he couldn’t teach an advanced course, and instead offered one that would have been considered sophomore level in Russia. After fielding so many questions about strength of materials, he convinced his boss to let him spend time translating and adapting his Russian strength of materials textbook for use by Westinghouse engineers. </p>
                    <p>As a powerful catalyst, an inspiring teacher, and a brilliant problem-solver, Timoshenko had attracted, and was therefore surrounded by a nucleus of highly talented Westinghouse engineers. In his four years at Westinghouse, Timoshenko published some 20 papers and one book. Having realized the critical need for a journal dedicated to engineering mechanics, Timoshenko also was instrumental in founding the Applied Mechanics Division of the A.S.M.E. and its Journal of Applied Mechanics.</p>
                    <p>But despite the opportunities presented at Westinghouse, Timoshenko was primarily a teacher who needed time to study and to write. He had formulated plans for books in his head, but needed time to develop them. </p>
                    <p>“I knew that as long as I remained at the [Westinghouse] factory,” Timoshenko wrote, “there would never be peace and quiet, and I would be unable to do work in science.” </p>
                    <h4 class="subheader">The Michigan Years</h4>
                    <p>In the spring of 1927, Timoshenko received a telegram from the University of Michigan School of Engineering dean, who invited him to found a school of Advanced Mechanics—the first its kind in the country—and to develop a research laboratory.</p>
                    <p>“It was the answer to my dream,” Timoshenko wrote. </p>
                    <p>And the beginning of the legacy he would build in altering American engineering pedagogy.</p>
                    <p>In short order Timoshenko would transform the engineering curriculum. He challenged the traditional teaching models for strength of materials, structural mechanics, and dynamics by emphasizing their core—which is mathematics. </p>
                    <p>Not that it was always smooth sailing.</p>
                    <p>Immediately Timoshenko had recognized certain oddities of the American university. Professors at that time were obliged to sit in their offices from nine to five, he once wrote, with a short break for lunch. But they “did not find this requirement burdensome because those who were engineers usually had private clients on the outside, whose work they would do on university time in their university offices, and in this way increase their earnings.” </p>
                    <p>He also recalled another time, when a group of professors had received a “dressing down” for getting drunk and “acting like hooligans” in front of students during a football game.</p>
                    <p>And he wasn’t entirely impressed by his students, either: “At Westinghouse I had been in contact with adults. Here at the university I had to deal with younger people, and they were strikingly coarse and ill-mannered. They had not a trace of respect for professors.” </p>
                    <p>As examples, Timoshenko noted that students would enter his office without first removing their hats and coats—or even so much as saying hello before launching into the reasons for their visits. On his way home, he would be annoyed that students wouldn’t even think to make way for him as they passed on the sidewalk, forcing Timoshenko to step aside and into mud puddles—which raised the ire of Mrs. Timoshenko, who grew weary of having to clean their floors of the dirt from her husband’s shoes. But once Timoshenko realized the problem, he decided not to make way for them, either. </p>
                    <p>“In view of my height and weight,” Timoshenko wrote, “the method worked.”</p>
                    <p>Timoshenko’s summer school program in mechanics—which he ran from 1929 until the mid-1930s—would prove vital to his efforts to combine theoretical and practical training. The program utilized both professors and working engineers, many of them Europeans educated in Germany and all of them advocates of engineering education with a theoretical foundation. The program also attracted doctoral candidates in mechanics, which burnished Michigan’s reputation.</p>
                    <p>About this time Timoshenko became a citizen of the United States, and in Ann Arbor his influence became much more pronounced than it was at Westinghouse. Timoshenko offered courses in Advanced Strength of Materials, Elasticity, Elastic Stability, Thin Plates and Shells, Vibration Analysis, Advanced Dynamics, Plasticity, and other advanced topics. He helped to develop the country’s first B.S. and Ph.D. programs in engineering mechanics, and graduate students came from all over the world to study under Timoshenko—and returned to spread his fame. He also drew famous colleagues, and the Summer Symposia of the Engineering Mechanics Department became world renown for their distinguished lectures. </p>
                    <p>Timoshenko was an engaging and dynamic teacher who was able to “bring a human dimension to a topic that in lesser hands might have been dull.” In an interview with the Technic conducted during his time at Michigan, Timoshenko “revealed” himself as “a man of calm dignity, congenial nature, and a sophisticated sense of humor.” When the writer noted that Timoshenko was interested in economics, “he smilingly confided that his brother, Vladimir, of the Business Administration school, probably knows more about the subject.” Timoshenko also was said to be “attracted… to concerts at Hill Auditorium… and we're certain that he has a poignant interest in literature.” </p>
                    <p>Many of Timoshenko’s students would come to be counted among the most prominent teachers of mechanics of their day, while others would become directors of large research and other organizations. And with the help of those students, Timoshenko would write seven new volumes in his eight-year Ann Arbor tenure. Most were advanced books on stress analysis and dynamics, which are still without equal. As the number of papers written by his distinguished students grew, Timoshenko wrote less often. Instead, he grew content to suggest avenues of investigation to them, and to aid in their research efforts. It has been said that Timoshenko had no students; they were all disciples. Certainly, few teachers have come to be as respected and admired.</p>
                    <h4 class="subheader">Later Years: Ideas Take Root</h4>
                    <p>In the 1930s Alexandra's health began to fail, and in 1936 Timoshenko accepted a post at Stanford, where the climate was more conducive to his wife’s condition. While at Stanford Timoshenko published another dozen engineering textbooks, as well as histories of strength of materials and engineering education in Russia. As they gained a following among American engineering faculties, his textbooks sowed the seeds of a permanent shift toward the theoretical and practical aspects of engineering. </p>
                    <p>Timoshenko continued to teach a few courses, and to conduct his famous seminars during World War II. In 1945 and 1948 he published two books—Theory of Structures and Advanced Dynamics. Shortly after the war he commuted to Europe regularly to collect data for a book on the history of mechanics. Occasionally he would stop to visit old friends in Ann Arbor, and during the Summer Session of 1949 he and his friend Sir Richard Southwell offered courses and conducted seminars in the Summer Symposium in Engineering Mechanics. </p>
                    <p>But it was the influx of federal money into American higher education in the post-WWII era that really helped Timoshenko’s ideas take root. Because most of that funding was directed at engineering scientists, it fueled the growth of graduate programs in engineering and encouraged engineering pedagogy to focus on math, science, and engineering mechanics. </p>
                    <p>And in response to those external forces, engineering departments reformed themselves. Many replaced hands-on, machine shop-type classes with science and math courses, and they hired professors with Ph.D.s to teach them. Timoshenko’s textbooks, which fused theory with the practical experience he had gained at Westinghouse, eased this difficult transition.</p>
                    <p>Some have recently suggested that engineering education might have veered too far toward theory, and that more practical training is once again needed. But whatever the future direction, Timoshenko’s impact remains unquestioned. The merger of both the theoretical and the practical laid the foundation for the next generation of engineers and their accomplishments, and his textbooks continue to help to educate engineers across America today. </p>
                    <p id="sticky05">Timoshenko redefined the discipline of engineering in the United States—and for this achievement the American Society of Mechanical Engineers created the Timoshenko Medal for contributions in applied mechanics, and honored Stephen P. Timoshenko as its first recipient in 1957. Dr. Timoshenko died in 1972.</p>
