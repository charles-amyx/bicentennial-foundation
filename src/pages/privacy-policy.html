                <h3>Acceptable Use</h3>
                <p>Michigan Engineering adheres to the guidelines for the <a href="http://spg.umich.edu/policy/601.07">Proper Use of Information Resources, Information Technology, and Networks at the University of Michigan</a> as outlined in the U-M Standard Practice Guide.</p>
                <h3>Privacy Policy</h3>
                <p>Michigan Engineering is committed to ensuring the privacy and accuracy of your confidential information. We do not actively share personal information gathered from our web environments. However, because the University of Michigan is a public institution, some information collected from our websites, including the summary server log information, emails sent to the websites, data collected through analytics software, and information collected from web-based forms, may be subject to the Freedom of Information Act. This means that while we do not actively share information, in some cases we may be compelled by law to release information gathered from our web environments.</p>
                <p>As part of our commitment to maintaining the privacy of our users, Michigan Engineering follows these guidelines:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="http://www.ro.umich.edu/ferpa/">Statement of Student Rights and Records</a></li>
                    <li><a href="http://cio.umich.edu/policy/">Information Technologies Policies at The University of Michigan</a></li>
                </ul>
                <p>The University of Michigan also complies with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), which prohibits the release of education records without student permission. Although FERPA regulations apply only to U-M students, the University of Michigan is equally committed to protecting the privacy of all visitors to our websites.</p>
